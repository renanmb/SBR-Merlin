Learning objectives: <br/>
(1) The main concepts and algorithms for SBR; <br/>
(2) How to process the data and create sequential features;<br/>
(3) How to create an SBR model with a simple MLP architecture first, then with an RNN-based architecture, and finally with a Transformer-based one using NVIDIA Merlin; and <br/>
(4) How to train/evaluate the models on GPU. <br/>


The tutorial consists of 5 notebooks: <br>
- 01-Data-analysis-and-preparation
- 02-ETL-with-NVTabular
- 03-Next-item-prediction-with-MLP
- 04-Next-item-prediction-with-LSTM
- 05-Next-item-prediction-with-Transformers
